                            <li>Administrators: Administrators are the ones who can add or administer the categories for the products, and administers the whole website information’s. Administrator has full privilege of the website.</li>
                            <li>Sellers/Farmers: Sellers are the farmers and they can sell their productions through online after the registration. After the registration the farmers can login to the system by entering login id and password. Farmers can hire workers as well by sending the work request. Farmer gets a message(SMS) to his registered mobile number when the customer sends a purchase request for his produce.</li>
                            <li>Customer: Customers can buy products through online. The customer can send purchase request to the farmer in order to buy the product. When the farmer sends the purchase order after receiving purchase request then the customer can make payment and buy the product. Customer gets a message to his/hers registered mobile number when the farmer sends purchase order for his produce.</li>
                            <li>Worker: Workers can receive various work requests from multiple farmers and they can also reject or approve a request depending upon their interest.
